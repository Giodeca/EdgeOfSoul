  text: The connection is starting to have issues, which sometimes happens.  Try
    every means to exit this plane. Utilize the photos from the Polaroid cameras
    you'll find in the rooms. You may experience slight stomach discomfort, but you'll
    understand the effect by pointing the photo in the right direction.  Sincerely, 
    Dr. Boss
