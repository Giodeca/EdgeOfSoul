  text: Welcome,  This is your Temporary Temporal Limbo (TTL).  A TTL is a personalized
    space where the human soul will traverse its own path based on the life it has
    led.  Currently, time is at a standstill, and your soul must choose whether to
    return to its previous state or to reintegrate with the existence of creation. 
    Please read the provided folders throughout your journey to understand how to
    proceed.   To move, use the W/A/S/D keys and use the mouse to control the camera.
    Press N to cover the 'pathing error' and restart the astral level  Sincerely, 
    Dr. Boss
