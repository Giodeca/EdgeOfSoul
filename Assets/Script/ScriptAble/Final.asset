  text: 'Unfortunately, we have been unable to recreate your experiences.   We can
    only analyze them on another astral plane located in a different dimension. 
    To assist you, I can only say this: unfortunately, we cannot provide you with
    the opportunity to use the newly acquired abilities here; we will use them in
    the other dimension. For now, I have granted you the power of creation. Utilize
    it to find the correct path. Reach the elevator before the plane turns you into
    something we never mention in the TTL. Remember, a step into the void can be
    a success or a failure, but it''s always better to take the risk.   Sincerely, 
    Dr. Boss  Notes on creating the plane:  For creating cube in this area click
    E You won''t be able to create them everywhere, only based on your path. Otherwise,
    use the viewfinder and escape.'
