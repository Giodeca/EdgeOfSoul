  text: To proceed on our journey,  The client is required to activate the computer
    located to the left. To do so, you will need to place something on the electricity
    platform to turn it on. It is recommended that the esteemed clients thoroughly
    examine the room to find what is needed to unlock the double-door entrance. The
    soul has found its room around you.  Sincerely,  Dr. Boss
