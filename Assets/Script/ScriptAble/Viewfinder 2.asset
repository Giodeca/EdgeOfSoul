  text: I must warn you...  Unfortunately, we are beginning to notice problems with
    the generation of the TTL. Despite our capabilities, we have detected unusual
    spatiotemporal activity. To continue the journey, we will need to use an emergency
    code. Find a way to exit using a combination of these platforms.  Sincerely, 
    Dr. Boss
